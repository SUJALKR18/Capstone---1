Negative,"This program will not play Blu-ray movies. The product description on the web page is unclear, it says that it plays ""popular format"", apparently not Blu-ray. You want to play blu-ray movies you have to upgrade to their Platinum edition. At least I think it plays movies, but I thought it does."
Neutral,"I had no luck trying to recover my files, but I couldn't do it would not work if my computer was in better condition."
Negative,"Check ""Windows Task Manager"" and you'll see the spy doctor pvtsSvc.exe program pushes CPU usage 100% of the time."
Negative,"I can't load Turbo Tax 22015 on Windows 10.1. Turbo Tax answered ""Sorry"" for the problem.....this question still remains to be answered""."
Neutral,"It's okay, but not as good as the Microsoft Surface Kindle app, which now has Amazon stopped downloading. Thank you, Amazon! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You're still allowing this app for iPhone and Droid, why is that? You're not at all happy with that app pulled."
Neutral,"Just be sure to have realistic expectations if you buy it...it's pretty dated and not a lot of fun.... for a 3-5 year old I would think pretty good though, helps them navigate the computer, learn a little bit, and get them Star Wars fix"
Neutral,"It's very user-friendly. Great software and GPS system, but the volume is too low. So if you're driving, you have to stop it outside. I'd say it's a good backup for your regular GPS if you're traveling constantly."
Positive,I will continue to use Amazon for all my shopping needs as a way to save time and money.
Negative,"I agree with ""Ocean Girl"". My problem and maybe her problem is that Furniture Maker is not compatible with TurboCAD Deluxe, but it requires professional version. It is according to TurboCAD technical support. Unfortunately it is not described described that Amazon /dp/B000IAJZ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Furniture Maker Plug in V"
Negative,"I just don't understand how this buggy, constantly crashing software is the ""industry standard"". The outlining features are horrific -- looks like they've used a hypercard program from 1989 as a model -- and the UI is also from another century. For the price, this should work well, be bug-free, and have an UI that makes it easy to navigate and use features. It's the opposite."
Negative,"I bought the Printmaster Gold 18 to replace the old version of the printer. My computer uses Windows XP, but my computer printer 18 was unable to read the installation disk. I thought the disk was faulty and returned it for an exchange twice. My email to Print Master's Tech Support remains unanswered. I finally realized that the installation disk is a DVD instead of a CD. My computer has a CD reader, but not a DVD player, so"
Positive,I love it... it was very easy to download and sync with my burn.
Positive,I got the key to following the instructions and it was easy to install no problems. Only downside is that you have to renew it once a year.
Neutral,Blatant attempt to collect privacy data. Hard to get through the first time.
Negative,"I can't believe how bad this release is. It was 2011 ""Office 2000/2003 for Windows"". Word and Excel crashed. Outlook hits the logs with crap, slowing down the entire machine. (El Cap - fresh install/8GB/i5) No monthly patch has been fixed. This doesn't help anything, clearing the logs and keychain entries for about a week."
Negative,I didn't like it so I returned it.
Negative,"I paid for about $120.00 for the software download, and the product key was completely missing. They sent me the second key, but I asked for a refund since I didn't activate it, and I got Office 365 much cheaper for my school through four years. But Amazon doesn't offer a refund for software downloads, ever. So I feel like I spent a lot of time on this purchase."
Positive,"Nice application to scan, track and edit documents. Pro would like to buy the version but a bit expensive, would you get a discount that if you bought the original version, let you upgrade?"
Neutral,Ended up not using this. Couldn't accommodate multi-state returns.
Neutral,"If you don't know it's really erased, or just normal format. Used to install fresh OS."
Neutral,"PrintMaster is fine if you just want to do that, use the built-in templates to simplify family newsletters, brochures, greeting cards, and stuff like that. I tried to use it for a little bit more (but not more) advanced -- a program for a roller derby bout. I found it difficult to work with, and the help system didn't work at all."
Positive,"Not only was the software in good condition and is working well, but it was delivered in incredibly short time."
Positive,Using Easy with some adjustments from older versions
Negative,"I completely regret the money spent on this product. One example: I have a personalized card ready to print, save it, yet when I get the print function, part of the text is missing, even opening the ""saved"" project has the same result. How is that possible? Other disappointments. So disappointed."
Positive,"First I want to say two things to those who complain that it doesn't work with their CD burner: o You should have checked the compatibility list o You should have downloaded the FREE 30-day trial Some pros for it: o It allows you to backup over networked drives (very cool) o It allows you to password protect your backups (cool again) A few cons: o I don't like the interface, I don't hate it"
Negative,This is bogus and it doesn't work! It's full of bugs and can't even be updated! I want my money back!
Negative,"FP 98, by far, is the best, and fastest HTML editor - although, it doesn't have all the shapes and bells of FP 2000 or FP 2002. FP 2000 is very sluggish. Using it is like typing in the ""Hunt and Peak"" method."
Negative,"I bought this product for my daughters in July 2009. I have a Mac OS-X. This version of Reader Rabbit is supposed to work with MacIntosh 7.1 and higher, but it doesn't. I tried online help to no avail. I agree with the writer of Beware Old Reviews. This product is not compatible with newer computers! Buy at your own risk!!"
Neutral,"I like how easy the product works, but after initial scan of my complete system, all the future scans seem to be only partial - there was no room to choose a partial or full scan."
Positive,"My 2-year-old is a huge fan of Pooh, and of course he took it right away. Some of the activities were rather unreasonable, but many were quite entertaining. Some math and language practice was very creative."
Negative,"Allume Systems, the creators of SpamCatcher, claim that they will not be supporting this software anytime soon and most product keys released this year are likely to be disabled because their servers are programmed to ignore the SpamCatcher product keys."
Positive,"I love this program. It's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's very helpful, it's"
Neutral,After installing windows said the product key had been blocked. I immediately filed a claim and responded with the seller within hours with a working product key.
Positive,The product doesn't seem like it's changed too much. I've used turbo tax for 5 this year.
Negative,"I've been very happy with the H&R Block software so far this year. Not so this year. Missing a form I need, and there's no way to tell until you get it. Updates have failed consistently. I've gone back and bought Turbo."
Positive,"Get the FULL Professional version for a lot less. Microsoft offers Microsoft Office Professional through the Home Use Program for $9.95, which is available to various companies, students, and military personnel. Follow these simple steps: Step 1. Go to http://tinyurl.com/kcn5wdn Step 2. Enter your work email address to check your company's eligibility. (Applies to student and military email as well) Step 3. Buy software and Microsoft Professional Plus 2013. What"
Negative,Why would my son charge $50 for this software to use it?
Positive,I've been using it for over 20 years. It makes money management a breeze. I'd recommend it to anyone who really cares about their financial situation.
Negative,"I positively HATE this upgrade. It came installed on my computer and I understand it is almost virtually impossible to downgrade. When there are updates, your computer will slow down to crawl, often running out of time. No start menu. I update daily because they're almost necessary and there are still many, they take at least an hour to do. Yesterday, in seven hours, I had three sets of updates that I had to do... It"
Negative,I'm completely surprised that this version doesn't include Microsoft's Outlook. Previous versions did so so I didn't even see it package to see that it wasn't included. Now I have a computer that I can't access my email on so I have to go to my old netbook to get my email. Very uncomfortable!
Neutral,"I've gone back and forth between different tax software products and I've decided on H&R Blocks version. Everything in it is automatic, it works as well as can be expected, and I think there are fewer sales pitches for upgrades, etc. than you find on other products. I found some frustrating things like this. My wife and I suggested file separately to pay lower taxes but when I went through all the trouble of filing two different retur"
Negative,Not a worldwide use of bad purchase.
Neutral,Continuing to download the free main version for problems....gave up.
Neutral,The Bueno.
Positive,Using Kaspersky for many years never got a problem.
Negative,"I got the package, I loaded it on my pc but when I arrived, I entered the product key with it, and a message said that the product key for that package was wrong."
Positive,"I've been using Adobe Photoshop for a few years now at a professional level. I've been having some trouble with my serial number recently and I was told that the serial number with my product I bought was not good! Well, most people know that Photoshop is very expensive. That's why, a few days ago, I decided to look for Photoshop alternatives and I got Corel Paint Shop Pro X4. I've been using a trial version that I've been download"
Negative,"My six-year-old son wasn't very interested in this game. It's very slow. You give feedback, then wait a few seconds, then you see the character doing something, then you get the next input."
Negative,Disappointed wouldn't work on my Windows 10 support.
Positive,User friendly and got the task completed.
Negative,"I've been a PC QuickKine user for 15 years. I just switched to about four Macs a week ago, and I hate it! There's no automatic solution. Balance adjustment doesn't make sense, and I never know how much money I really have."
Negative,I've been pretty frustrated. Beware of this program. Beware of the following: 1. The templates of this program have serious limitations. The outputs for printed documents are also definitely deeply discounted. And the graphics options for personal assistance are extremely limited. Perhaps because they want you to buy this software. They also sell the latest version of Avanquest Bookkeeper software. I was pretty frustrated. Beware of the early version of this
Negative,"I found this product very difficult to get to ""fuse' my XP with the Mac. In fact, I've been trying for four days; I've emailed VMware and they have yet to respond. The on-line tutorials make it very simple; no! <a data-hook=""product-link-linked-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VMware-Fusion-2/dp/"
Neutral,"This is my first time using TurboTax and although the input from my w2's was simple, anything you do freelance is confusing."
Positive,That's great.
Negative,I mistakenly bought this one and have to call TurboTax multiple times and still won't be able to get the download version. Their customer service is horrible and you have to wait and wait to speak to a representative.
Positive,It's working well.
Neutral,It does have a popup when I try to shut down the program for a link to the mobile alert app. I won't show it again to click the box but there is no submit or OK button. I have to click on x to shut down the popup or hit ESC to shut down the program. Popup eventually stopped appearing.
Positive,This is great software.
Negative,Didn't work on all my old laptop.
Positive,Funny movie
Neutral,"You might think they'll take care of their customers but if you renew, if you shop online, the same product costs more and you buy as a new customer."
Neutral,Running Yosemite now which cured my almost fatal buggy maverick installation.
Negative,The software is not compatible with previous year's tax returns completed online
Positive,Enjoy this product. It'll be a lot to buy again.
Positive,"My son with autism loves math, Blasters. I would have had it in modern OS's though."
Positive,I'm very happy with it.
Positive,I'm happy with the program and I like all of the features but it's been trying to update for the last two weeks and every failed time.
Neutral,"I was trying to get a program that I could use with Windows 7. When I upgraded from Vista to 7, I was not able to use my older forms program. I finally hit on this and it did work. It works for me but if you have to use it every day it can be a bit painful. I don't know how to do that. Just open a ready form and start working."
Positive,The program was rushed and it saved me money on my income tax.
Negative,"So, I wasted my money and won't get it back because I opened the package. The only requirements shown for this program are that you need a CD drive so it leaves you thinking that it will work on any computer."
Negative,"It's hard to believe that anyone selling home Windows software will not support Windows Vista in some form or form, but this is evident in the case of Encore's (Broadband) KidPix 4. Oh it's installed, but not in full screen mode that allows it to be usable by any young kid like version 3 did under XP. Your only choice is to manually set your screen resolution to 800x600 and then reset it when you're"
Positive,"I've had Norton 360 for several years now. Always displayed as advertised. It was delivered on time, installed without any interruption. If you look hard enough, it can be purchased very reasonably."
Negative,"If you don't already know how to use Nero, don't buy this product. Finding out how to do things, or even finding out what is possible to do that you need to do, is frustrating and time consuming. I shouldn't have to search the web to find out how the program works."
Neutral,"I really liked Managing Your Money back in the 1990s, and when that went away I switched to Microsoft Money. Unfortunately for me, Microsoft had waived support for MS Money a few years ago and I had to switch back to QuickKn at that time. Recently thanks to the ""Free If You Review It"" program, I upgraded from QuickKn 2011 to QuickKn 2012. There are some minor differences from one version to the next, but that for me"
Neutral,Didn't tell us it will cost more to continue with the product next year
Negative,It showed I owed the IRS $2905 tax on $5864 taxable income; about. 50% tax!
Negative,The product doesn't match my computer as recognized in Macafee told me so I want to go back to it
Positive,"I'm glad I did because I did what I did myself, and it saved me about $500, mostly through vague rules that I've never heard of. But beware: it's only for federal taxes, not state taxes."
Negative,This product has been another six times. I want my money back.
Positive,"I've been using turbo tax for years, although it's a bit expensive. As with anything, you get what you're willing to pay for. I'm confident that it does a thorough job of guiding me through my tax preparation, yielding accurate and convincing results."
Negative,"With all the other programs shut down and nothing else going on, the timer kept changing, eventually rising to 6 hours and 41 minutes. With such a wide deviation, it doesn't seem like a product where it was taken very care of. I wouldn't recommend. Endless frustration and 1/2 a day wasted by Kaspersky's incorrect information."
Positive,"Every issue of the incredible Hulk through December 2006. No limited series, no guest appearances, but over 500 scanned issues of the Hulk. The images don't have the quality of the masterworks version, but I gave it five stars anyway."
Neutral,"I've been using Turbo Tax for quite some time now, and I'm bored with its constant marketing/advertising and data-grab methods. For example, a commercial plus Premier started with a data grab, asking for personal information that was then stored in Intuit's database and used to send you more ads. It's very annoying. Good software should do its job and not sell it. Now, for software: it has problems"
Negative,I couldn't find it to work just wouldn't load.
Neutral,I had immediate issues developing and a quick call to Intuit to tell me that I had loaded R2 during the current release. It was R6. I was easy enough to go through the steps I was given in the chat session but a little disappointed that it needed to take time to bring it up to date.
Positive,I'm very pleased with the purchase of this product and ease of transaction and fast download! My laptop is now secure for all my internet use! Very happy customer :)
Neutral,Just found it a little hard to use and also not so user-friendly... words/phrases you're learning too I would have chosen to start with things I wasn't.
Positive,"I used Trend Micro for many years and thought it was the best. Then I had to buy a new laptop and got Kaspersky internet security free with it, and I loved it too."
Neutral,Other MSFT like office purchases I need this for work. so I bought it. and it works so I use it.
Neutral,"If you've been a Mac user for a long time, you probably already know the RoxyToast Burner software. It's an upgrade from version 12 (don't worry, you haven't lost anything since version 13 was never released), and here's not really that new."
Positive,"I have a trial version on my computer now. I have to admit that the only problem with it is that it often does something you don't want to do, but only if you drag a file that was originally from the PC version. For some reason, Mac has a little trouble reading the original PC files, although it's no problem fixing it."
Negative,This program gave me six options that I never had a password or anything close to the style of the password I used. It actually gave me the same six options on each of my four email accounts or PST files. How is it possible if this product actually works?
Negative,"I upgraded from Quicken 2011 specifically to use the mobile app, which I learned after purchasing and installing the upgrade does not work with non-US dollar accounts. Many have commented on this on Quicken's website, and Quicken has not responded to any comments."
Negative,I've ordered this item twice and I've never received the item from either party. I'm not very happy with Amazon about this. I was credited with one of the items but the other one NEVER showed up as credit on my visa.
Negative,This software was a waste of money and plastic disks. From PRO: It worked initially.... but only once and I was able to back up a DVD. From Congress: It never worked afterwards. Nothing on error messages and application hang. Installed it on my other computer with the same results [both running XP]. Tech support provided soothing words promising a fix through our email exchanges that never happened.
Positive,Turbo Tax is always great. Buy it every year Amazon for a great price. It was in 2012 and I bought it. Used download option and had zero issues. I would recommend this product and download method to everyone.
Positive,I like what Autodesk has done to this upgrade version.
Neutral,"Unfortunately, this disc will not even run in compatibility mode for previous releases on Windows (which will usually run in older software, Win XP and earlier) if you have an old PC (probably using stone-built age, chassis and stick) I recommend you go for it, your child will love it."
Neutral,"It loads very slowly and crashes very quickly. USB capture works well for both VHS accessories and DVD sources. So far I have been pleased with the software except for the unexpected and unpredictable crashes. Tonight I spent an hour editing a video and, as I was watching it last time, puff... windows shut down and went to work for an hour. Remember to save your work over and over again! It's"
Negative,Will someone please tell me how to uninstall the nitro pro?
Neutral,I uploaded it to my laptop but I couldn't get it up to load my tablet.
Negative,I had to upgrade to the premiere because they didn't. I had a form I needed on the deluxe.
Positive,"This does everything most people will want to do with photos and more, reliably and without much hassle, comparatively speaking. Some of the features do require some figuring out, and may not work as desired without some tweaking, but there's good help available, and since you can easily experiment without destroying anything, it can be fun to figure out. On my PowerBook with a 2.2 GHz i7 processor and 8 GB 1333 MHz RAM it"
Neutral,"First of all, let me be clear: I hate Microsoft. I hate their monopoly business practices, I think their software is average, and I hate the fact that they've air conditioned computer users everywhere to believe that anything that's not from Microsoft is 'suspicious'. On my home laptop, I run Ubuntu Linux with LibreOffice and it works very well for me; I can do everything I need to do and a lot of it. I'm saying,"
Positive,"Because we have QuickBooks online, I have all my customer information on my phone all the time. When a customer calls, a QuickBooks icon comes up there. My customers are affected by how much I know about them before I say a word. They think I have a great memory. Thanks to QuickBooks!!!! I recommend QuickBooks to small businesses that I see on an almost daily basis. People are blown away by what we can all do now than before the online"
Negative,It'll just update a few drivers and then you want to pay more for others. Turns out this is an old version
Positive,Thank you product was as I expected it gave me tools for everyday business use that I hadn't had before.
Negative,This version of Final Cut Pro won't load. The box is labeled as a single use version. This is worthless and I'm out of $75.
Positive,Recommended by several reliable PC product magazines
Positive,I love new Quicken. Such a great program for home use.
Neutral,"I've been using H&R Block software for several years and I've found it very user friendly but through. My only complaint is that there's no cross-referencing of it from the online software downloads so you have to re-enter old data, other smart ones a great product."
Positive,Great.
Negative,"I've been with QuickOn since the late 1990s and I'm very disappointed with the downloading issues of transactions... don't even try to use San Diego County Credit Union and QuickOn... it won't work until you have an IT degree. I finally gave up! Now, as I open my computer today and open my 2008 home and business, it gives me a good warning that when I don't upgrade, they'll cut off my downloading capa"
Positive,"BMax's FB wall is an Amazon elevator. Nothing better than coming to work, jumping in the elevator, and knowing what's happening with Bimax."
Negative,"This product consists of 5 separate programs that import and export each other's file formats. Most importantly, unless you follow a VERY narrow path of click here, click there, your car crashes. Not so much, but DV support is very small. I found that I try to capture the same clip twice, the software will be a little bit wrong - starting a frame or completing a full frame or a terrific project."
Positive,"I've been using this antivirus for 2 years and it works better than any other antivirus I've used in the past, remarkably free to stay."
Positive,This is the best spelling software that I have ever used. The program can be modified and adjusted according to a student's needs. I like that I can record my own according to my own standards without relying on other people. I highly recommend it for students of all ages. Although it is not a game or toy.
Neutral,This product recovers files from your hard drive but it doesn't delete them. That's what I was looking for.
Positive,Arrived very quickly. Very satisfied.
Neutral,"Although TT did fix things without charging for it this year, I didn't like the surprise of upgrading to a business version of Schedule C and other forms that were regularly deluxe version before this year. Looks like going forward, will have to cough up the extra bucks. And the only reason I had to do this was because I get about $50 a year from a nearby natural gas fracking as well as the royalties."
Neutral,"I think TurboTaxis is a good tax item, but it's very tiring to use ""what"" for if I do this, or not"" tax planning. I would have liked a better way to see what the various possible ways of managing the deductions would be."
Negative,The Ubuntu loaded on my computer easily... but... wouldn't open or run... I took it to a local PC repair shop... they tried for days... out that there were a few lines of corrupt code that wouldn't allow the program to run... so this disk was a waste of money...
Neutral,Works fine but why does Intuit make buying the new version cheaper just to pay for the annual subscription. Would be a lot easier to pay the subscription but is twice as expensive
Negative,"This is the worst product of its kind on the market that I've ever tried. Constant crashes, slow performance, won't save a file on your server without a huge hassle (fails to save your changes or simply deletes them during upload) and easily triggers servers like 1&1 when you need to upload corrections to your file, like when you upload a file, when you're testing a hacker to think you're going to stop it"
Negative,I tried it. It didn't work. I uninstalled it.
Negative,"TT said we'd get a refund or something if we had used TT Deluxe last year, but didn't say how to do that."
Negative,"I can't comment on the software yet, although I'm generally satisfied with the last year. Based on my experiences from last year, my only disappointment with the program is that Intuit blames you for the state program and the e-file ($30, roughly). Now, don't download the year's version for it. At least, don't until the downloader error is fixed. I got the program downloaded this morning"
Positive,"< a data hook = ""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Echo</a>"
Positive,"I absolutely abhorred the PC version and it took me hours to do my receipts. But you know the saying, ""the Devil you know..."". Either Neat has recently come out with a much more intuitive/functional update to Neatworks for Mac, so anything else I wanted to do is to get the best of the best of the best. But I'm sure that you'll get the best of the best of the best of the best of"
Neutral,I don't like the 'old' interface of several years ago - I don't feel it's nearly as comfortable as it used to be.
Positive,Good product
Positive,"We got it on my laptop, great backup, and it works great with my GPS."
Positive,Exactly as described.
Neutral,"I bought this program to brush up on Math for my SATs. Although it's useful grade algebra to remind you of some things you forgot about since the 9th, it doesn't offer much variety. Practices are not at all useful because the questions never change."
Neutral,"I support a bunch of Windows 7 PCs with non-administrator accounts. First of all, I'm a little disappointed that Windows 7 non-administrator accounts can actually be affected to a big degree by malware. It seems like I have a bug. But that's a separate issue."
Negative,I had a Kaspersky product. It started to get unreliable. I tried this and even with a Nerds To Go Representative we could never load it. I believe the reviews are fake reviews. The Nerds to Go representative said he had never seen something hard to try and load.
Neutral,"It's not bad. There were a couple of bugs that I've been hearing a few times. Also, the website they mentioned for the worksheet no longer exists."
Negative,"I think for $7.99 I have no problem with any other program. (Note that I'm running on Windows 98 SE with MB of Ram, so I'm not disappointed at the minimum requirements.) (Tab 2) The program is very difficult to run out. It's completely non-standard for a running alt. It's completely non-standard for a running alt. There are no main characters, and no animated buttons on the Alt. But I"
Neutral,I've worked hard to enter and the interface after using the online version is unpolished and rough. It's a huge improvement over versions I used 5-10 years ago but if at all possible I'd just stay online.
Positive,"I recently bought Kaspersky Internet Security software. By buying it through Amazon, it was a great value. It keeps my computer protected. I've used it in the past. It's much better than other anti-virus products I've used."
Negative,"I bought Quickbooks, and found I had difficulties getting it to register. I called Tech Support, and for an hour and a half they insisted that my OS was too new for that version. They said that the CD that allows the trial version to run would let me use the program 15 times before I shut down. 15 times the trial version would work on my OS? But the registered version wouldn't?"
Neutral,Too expensive.
Positive,The previous version had serious problems with too many fonts on a screen and you couldn't read most of the screen. We've been using QuickTime for years and that was the first time the version was weird.
Neutral,"Although it includes a ""browser"" that allows you to select an image from a specific image editor, the white browser may not add any value to the image. 2) If the original user interface is too clunky to be pasted, it is really, really difficult to overcome. Some examples: 1) It is really a program for working on a single image. Although it includes a ""browser"" that allows you to select an image from a specific image editor,"
Negative,"I bought it because a friend said it was good. If you grew up with Apple with Photo Shop, this is NOT a good option."
Positive,Old is gold
Negative,I was sent the wrong product and never got the product I wanted.
Positive,"Every time I use TurboTax, I'm reminded what a waste of money H&R Block was. It's simple, fast, and looks like the same system H&R Block uses."
Positive,"The three programs all have more graphic templates, better integration with each other, and new features for playing games. The biggest changes are in numbers, which means that it's a new member of the suite. Apple 90 has made new functions. Now, not just power spreadsheet users, but templates don't need all of them, but many of them are appreciated."
Negative,"The state wasn't involved back, so I had to pay an additional to $40 compute my state taxes."
Neutral,"But as the days went by and the honeymoon period ended, I noticed some serious limitations - which I think will evolve in the new version. But I guess it's not obvious that most people would. But try to find out how to create some other softwares. But if you try to create some new, especially if you're not using the same software, then you can only see that when you click on the third-party software, but also when you"
Neutral,"I had a Windows 8 Pro, but the key won't work."
Positive,"It worked again, however I'm getting a little bit more complicated."
Neutral,"I like the fact that I can download info for my checking and credit card accounts and keep everything up with very little effort to date. Since I'm semi-retired and shutting down my business, and it's what I need, I thought I'd never buy another update. I was using Quicken Deluxe 2013, everything was fine, and then Intuit shut down my download capabilities. To get it back, I had to buy the Quicken"
Positive,"Of course, it's an insurance policy... but you can't lose it when you need it. I had to replace my C drive and be able to copy my failed C drive to a new and larger SSD C drive without skipping a beat! Fired right up and started working in no time! That's what I'm talking about!!"
Negative,"Yeah, it sucks because they don't show how to download it."
Neutral,"It seems Microsoft is working towards the non use of computers. This seems set up for smart phones and iPads, very bad."
Neutral,There's no Mac Store nearby so I can get help with some features. I like my Toshiba. Thank you.
Neutral,"I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I can usually get a program like this run, but this one was difficult. It kept stopping midway through installation. It was very frustrating. Once I got it working it kept it crashed. I called the manufacturer's CS department but no help."
Positive,"Oh! my interest in petz started when we got dogz1 as a kind of bonus to buy a Hewlet Packard printer. As it turned out, I wanted Dogz3 later (4 not out yet). After a hundred petz, lots of downloads and about a year, Dogz 4 came out and I got it. Dogz 4 is wonderful, though downloads are sparse."
Positive,This is a great program. I don't know much about it program but it's very easy to use. It's not complicated and it's very easy to use.
Neutral,"If you have a new Samsung Android smartphone like the Galaxy Note 3 or Galaxy S4, it has a built-in security feature called KNOX. It is more likely to conflict with prominent anti-virus or Internet security apps. These security apps require administrative access to features such as remotely deleting. phone and activating the camera. Although intentional, KNOX will probably refuse such access. There have been several documented cases of this on the S4."
Neutral,"So now I have all the latest security and performance features under the hood, and the old interface that I've come to love over the past 20 or so years on top so far. So far I've been buying a Windows 7 Pro license and it's very fast and stable on my work and home computers."
Neutral,"If you compact your data, you lose a lot of details, which is no good for our retail business because compacting customer transactions would erase details like warranties and serial numbers. If your business is successful, you can move QuickBook faster. Unfortunately for us, the next step for more storage is $1,000 plus enterprise programs. This is a lot for a single location company."
Negative,I found one of those fake antivirus trojans that won't leave you alone and Norton didn't even notice it was there! It had blocked several attempts to get into my computer but yesterday suddenly my computer got infected!
Neutral,"And who misspelled ""scheduled""? When I downloaded an item from a bank or other account, it's matching a problem -- he says that two things might match, but the first one is an error, something from a year or two ago, or something that doesn't even exist -- something that's made it up quickly! It makes it take longer for me to check my downloads."
Positive,"This was a great power deal, and this is McAfee, which is my favorite virus protection out there."
Positive,Easy to use.
Positive,Installed with ease and seems better work software then end 2013 virus checker.
Neutral,"I'm crazy about technology, so I had my techie friends help. This is an average program."
Positive,I'm worried about a lot of bad reviews on this product. For me it works like Office always has. I mostly use Work and Excel. Not power user but it does whatever I need and I'm familiar with it format.
Negative,"I paid $69.99 for it instead of the comparable H&R Block Premium version, which I've used for years because of the reviews and Amazon Gift Card deal I've seen. The download and installation went well and fast. However, when I tried to import my H&R Block 2012 return, I found that it only accepts TT file types or PDFs. Then I started to worry - I found it hard to believe that a PDF could prove where any"
Neutral,"1) My external hard drive connected to USB 2.0 port under Windows XP Professional cannot recognize PC backup, even after a reboot. I have to Browse and point to it every time the software starts up. 2) It cannot run incremental backup on demand. Instead, an incremental backup should be scheduled. 3) It is slower than the backup that is available for free with Windows XP. If you are unhappy with Windows XP backup, and the features mentioned in the above reviews"
Neutral,Buyer's Warning: Software update allow HDD installation are not being advertised as. As of 23 November it is still a beta product without full functionality. [...]
Positive,"I was diagnosed with bipolar about six or seven years ago. I was confused, I had very limited memory and I couldn't balance my (simple) checkbook. And I'm a CPA. As I worked to find the medication levels I needed, I was still very depressed -- for about four years."
Negative,"I don't think I was told when I got my 2004 copy. I can't see that they improved anything on it. I had something similar with Quick Books. The last update release for the version I had, made it stop working with IE 7. When I removed and reinstalled it worked with IE 7, then I downloaded the update and it stopped working again. So the second time I deleted it and re-loaded it from the CD. This time I didn"
Neutral,"I had to buy a $40 book to learn what fundamentals I couldn't pick up by clicking randomly on various buttons. Otherwise, the program does what it's supposed to do, except that they're apparently having some other animation programs that they're shutting down that create animations that don't load properly in 3ds max."
Neutral,"I have accumulated a number of graphics editors that came bundled with various graphics products, and some with Windows itself. Of all these I found PhotoImpact to be the most useful, although it has a number of bugs and drawbacks (e.g.: having to click Edit and scroll down every time to crop crop photos quickly gets outdated). Unfortunately, uLead leaves much to be desired - it takes a lot of"
Negative,"I bought this thing and unfortunately it wasn't enough for the task. The third top of the pictures became greenish or pinky in almost all the video that I tried. I also tried to get better signals by buying a new VCR, a digital video stabilizer and other things."
Negative,An update to the product disabled it on my computer and TurboTax support was unable to fix the problem.
Neutral,"So, I've been a longtime H&R Block Tax software customer. I've always been happy with the product, and the price is lower than the price - TurboTax or humans. That said, I just struggled with a frustrating installation process and finally got the happy support issue out. After installing in 2013, the business' first order was to download a software update (federal). The update was downloaded, and then the software failed during the"
Negative,"So many other people have said it so well. I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product. I will just add that I am another longtime printer user. When my old Platinum 15 version got corrupted, I decided that I would try a new ""upgrade"". I never went to a printer product. I was so disappointed with a printer product. They took so much that I fell in love with old programs and added things that I hate."
Neutral,Still hard to use and get very hard to use follow the instructions will work well on Mac
Neutral,3.5 is too complicated to use. Also for me it was impossible to find a manual. I'm sad that I paid so much for 3.5 money.
Neutral,"If you are new to tech writing, I'd suggest getting this product as it will stand to you in your long-term career development. This is by no means cheap, but if you contract a lucrative frame maker, you've justified the cost of the product. I like to say, it's for those who are serious about a career in tech writing, or with other types of applications like Madcap or DIT. The interface and feature list is not that"
Positive,"I've tried more partitioning tools than I can count, including partitioning. Magic but none works like Partition Commander. It does exactly what it's called, it does nothing, nothing less."
Negative,"PTC attempts to convert a good product into some kind of word processor with the ribbon scheme used by Microsoft. Forget to paste a maths equation to clarify the analytics, not authorized. You have to save the equation in a JPG and lose resolution."
Neutral,"It does great job with keeping up with finances, but there has been a slightly obvious change in the desktop version and no current user can wait until next year before upgrading."
Positive,"Need to expand the donation section, go to any Salvation Army and find out what they're taking for sale in their store. Don't advertise free e-file and then charge for state e-file."
Neutral,"You can't learn to drive from watching videos and reading books. With that in mind, I found the CD-Rom, Driving School. I put it in front of my teenager hoping that he will use it to practice his driving skills and be able to learn some lessons from the things he can do on the road. He declared the game ""lost"" and never touched it again after the first round."
Negative,"I've had a problem where I can't open a file. For over an hour, there is still no resolution, the error message remains and I can't access and it's been about a week. I had to pay to download a state form that I can't use. No refunds for the program or state tax form."
Positive,"Average is always the best choice, but I wanted more utilities for the price, but I'm using it and now I've upgraded it in 2014."
Negative,I give this software one star because who in the world speaks northern Vietnamese in the United States who are mainly South Vietnamese immigrants. They seem fat and who in their right minds has to pay $171.60 for something that is not useful for anyone who wants to speak South Vietnamese.
Positive,Been using Turbo for many tax years and found the product to work for us.
Negative,"Description indicates it's for Mac AND PC. On CD, user is instructed to ""Double-click on QPict icon"". There is no QPict icon. It cannot be activated from my OSX Mac. Technical support cannot be accessed online -- no longer available (on the scale?). Phone help co$t$. Funny and frustrating! I wanted to jump through any reasonable hoops that Mac users might face; and to other"
Positive,"I recently bought this software to help me design hiking routes to use my Garmin GPS Map60CSx. It only took me a few minutes to learn, and I thought it was easy to create routes and webpoints. The integration with GPS was intuitive, and the images are beautiful. You can create height profiles, view your route in animated 3D, and National Geographic Map Exchange server allows you to find and download routes to use this software from"
Negative,"I thought you'd be able to make a beat like a drum kit from hell... this is just different drum sound, which is a mixed path very little compared to a drum kit from hell... I don't know what's going on... this is not what I thought."
Neutral,I had done a sale of 1000 shares of ETFC out of the 4000 owned by ETFC. Automatic e*trade online update collected I got 3000 new shares of ETFC but there was no sale or cash from the sale. The sale was already approved and settled on e*trade.
Negative,"I was very disappointed that this version of Oregon Trail, the 5th version, doesn't work on a new Mac (10.5 or above) because it lacks the required fonts. It was impossible for me to find fonts, and the program was worthless."
Neutral,Not easy to transition from TurboTax or at least it wasn't as clear as it could have been. The user interface is very Spartan. I liked the TurboTax interview process a lot. I'm not sure about using it to move forward. It's cheap but more frustrating than TurboTax.
Neutral,"Well... gets bogs stuff page ""you can do"" but nothing works."
Positive,"As a Norton user for many years, I can say that while Norton was easier to install/activate, that as far as protection McAfee found a few things Norton didn't do for me, and McAfee is also quite inexpensive. It seems that the system resources are almost the same as the Norton products I've used in the past."
Negative,I bought it because I had paperport years ago and then it worked well. Nuance turned a great product into a POS! It's now a very buggy product. It's hard to find the common features to work with.
Negative,"All views or opinions represented in this review are personal and belong solely to myself or my family members and do not represent the seller in any way, shape or form. My goal is to help you, the end user make an educated buying decision but I ask you to buy based on your own discretion. I am an Amazon reviewer and although I am getting a discount to review this product, I am going to give you the most honest possible review to help"
Positive,It's been using it for a few weeks and it's done what it was for.
Negative,I have a debilitating disease and I'm losing the ability to type and I've bought five upgrades and now I've got enough. For one their tech support doesn't understand English. Two: the blue tooth they sell doesn't work properly. Three: they say it's 99% correct. It's flat out lying it's not anywhere near. Four: My profile keeps getting damaged and I have to retrain on it all
Positive,I got this set from my kids for Christmas and love it. I wish they had the giant-sized issues in them but this is a great way to look at these old books and let your kids enjoy them too.
Negative,It's not working. It won't be downloaded to my computer.
Positive,"I bought this obviously to learn a third language. I got off to a strong start and it worked. I was learning fast. I stopped and paid the price. I'm starting over, but don't get me wrong."
Neutral,It's a little less useful when working on plot but overall I would recommend this software for beginners out in writing and wanting to develop characters that make sense.
Neutral,"As soon as I master this easy program, I'll post another review."
Negative,"[ASIN:B0006SE5BQ Singing Coach Unlimited] I bought Singing Coach Unlimited on March 8. In the meantime, my computer crashed and only Windows Vista was available, which was already on all new computers. I was told that Windows Vista, which is my new computer, would be compatible with Windows 98 programs. (Not so) I contacted a technician for Singing Coach Unlimited. He said the reason the program would not"
Positive,"I had to install Family Tree Maker 2005 for that. I was able to convert files and it seems to be running OK. It's different from the version I had, but also new. I'm running Windows 8 on my computer. I didn't use the free trial of Geneology, because I didn't want to give my credit card the number to do that."
Positive,What a job and saved me many hours of work!
Negative,"I've been using QuickOn since around 1990, I believe the first version was QuickOn2. QuickOn2016 is the most incredible version ever. It loads slowly, transactions are updated slowly, online access all crashes the time, Downloading bills is a great new feature that has caused the program to encounter critical errors."
Negative,This book was wrong book I needed understanding not introduction I have a book here I would need to get it know you have it back
Neutral,It's kind of old and my tech told me I could only use it once so I haven't tried it yet. I'm sure there are better newer ones out there that could be a lot nicer.
Positive,"At least H&R Fool didn't get all their customers to pay for the same product as TT did this year. And for some reason, many TT users are already finishing reporting tax fraud for returns filed by other people. Umm..... I went from TT to H&R for example a year ago when their Premium form TT got too big and started to pay more for equivalent products."
Negative,"I was just looking for a software that would guide me through good spending management and reduce debt in the longer term, but this piece of [junk] has so much to offer you and doesn't even respond to your needs!"
Positive,Excellent
Neutral,"It takes about 1/2 gig on my drive. It takes a lot of time to open. It's very slow to start, and it offers a lot of options. I want to use it with my PayPal account, my eBay sales and my other sales, and in some cases, it does a very good job, such as in creating categories, accounts and customer data."
Negative,No schedule C included this year. It's a downgraded product. I'll try an alternate program next year.
Neutral,I got about halfway through this and lost feeling it feels like a tutorial either not for missing steps or beginners. Intermediate users and ups might get some use out of it or maybe if you had previous studies with PHP.
Negative,"However, ""transparent"" brushes, which paint with pieces of the underlying image (unless you are eager for days of decoupage or ""hand-painted"" portraits) can certainly give them taste-picking and seem like a waste of time. The filter overlay takes them minutes to do what it can do in seconds. However, ""transparent"" brushes, which are uncomfortable with the underlying image bits"
Neutral,"Takes up extra space on the computer, finally went to Webroot."
Negative,"I bought this item to update the existing software and found that the software has big flaws. Especially you can't access ""company snapshot"" information, which is crucial when running a business. I contacted QB and was told their ""tech department"" is working on the problem."
Negative,"Amazon Downloader doesn't work with any 64-bit version of Windows, so if you have a high-end computer, don't bother. And why do companies think that forcing users to install software on their PCs is just a good idea?"
Neutral,"I am not entirely fond of the Spyder 2, but it is much better than Adobe Gamma. One catch is that it does not take into account ambient lighting like Eye One display products. This requires manual adjustment of monitor controls rather than using a simple, almost universal interface."
Negative,"Claims that it can import TurboTax details from previous years, but it cannot import PDFs into returns, which is TurboTax provides information from the previous tax year."
Negative,"I've been using Paint Shop since it started with JASC. While I enjoy the product and the results I get from the app X6, Corel has made it impossible to get rid of their NagWare. At least on previous versions, they provided you with a way to opt-out. With their latest version (X6) that option is no longer available. So, if you want a quality product and don't mind getting pop-up messages every time you go out"
Positive,"Really good product, every thing I expected."
Positive,Right price and features for upgrading or rebuilding a system
Positive,"I bought the product because Explorer is being infected by some kind of virus or bug that affected my PC. I'm very satisfied, as are my friends with them."
Positive,"I've been using TurboTax for 5 years (before, my dad even taxed me with TurboTax). Having a father who is a CPA and senior VP of accounting, it helped me build my confidence in the product. The first few years I used TurboTax, I had my dad check over my returns before submitting (just to double check). Having been error free, I believe that everyone can successfully use this product."
Positive,"(Introduction: I don't have QB2003, I'm a pro-2001 user, but after reading it, I was thinking about upgrading, I changed my mind... Very bad, anyway, I'll talk about 2001) ... I really liked this program, I learned all about it on my own... Like anything you get used to it, for a small business, it's relatively easy. I've never used any other program and"
Negative,$53.00 paid and it's not load after 30 minutes
Neutral,"I actually wouldn't mind paying a fee annually, but QB 2016 has been out for several months now, and the software still doesn't seem to be compatible with QB 2016. I have the necessary clients to update QB 2013 to QB 2016 for payroll before June. I still recommend the product, but certainly could be better."
Negative,"I've never bought a new PC with Windows XP, but I've found it IMPOSSIBLE to use, except for disk copy. Now suddenly it won't recognize the burner. I would install version 5 but it's not compatible with XP. As far as I'm concerned, version 6 should never have been released and Roxio should give a super discount on 7 to people who bought version 6 out of embarrassment nothing else and I'"
Positive,"It's a ""fun"" CD. No, it doesn't teach you fluency, but it's a nice way to learn a little bit about each language, learn a few basic things about each language, and then determine which language you want to go deeper into. I love it."
Positive,Excellent application when you have problems you can restore your computer within 7 minutes.
Positive,I don't say it's the best because I haven't used any other but the fact that I don't want to change a lot tells me that I'm not going to change a lot.
Neutral,I've been using dragons with them for about 3 years now through their upgrades to 11.5. They have issues with Outlook 2013 11.5 causing it to crash. Don't spend this much money on software until their hidden problem is fixed. Beware!
Positive,"After every lesson, you find yourself amazed at what you remember, sometimes even awed, blowing away your expectations or fears of failure. I tried Living Language and it's not even comparable to Rosetta Stone. Definitely worth the price!"
Positive,Immediate downloads saved almost $50!
Neutral,"And it took about 5 tries before it was finally installed. And each time takes close to 2 hours, so you need a little patience. I'm not sure what the problem was, but it's finally working. And I think you're taking it on the belief that the new version is an improvement, as I haven't seen any difference yet...."
Neutral,"The software itself is easy to use and intuitive. But unlike activation and other stupid trial software, which is very easy to use, there is no problem recording audio. Follow: When I bought the software from the Movavi site, I was finally rewarded with a continuous registration rejection solution. It was removed from the Hard Drive Registry by a freerider, after which they have been working with the software, and it has been removing some of"
Neutral,Great for computers with Windows 7 or 8.10 was very smart. Also couldn't get help installing it on my iPad. The simple installation required 24 apps to download. Guess I'll go to something else for iPad.
Neutral,"Very confusing and busy interface. Difficult to navigate and work with. Instead of trying Apple's iWork, all the documents that it doesn't do require full interoperability with PC counterparts of Office it is by far superior."
Negative,"Windows ""upgrades"" are WORSE THAN USELESS. I had to buy Windows 8 with my new tablet, and it is absolute trash-much harder to even access your desktop than with Windows 7, and it keeps slamming unwanted applications onto the screen when I try to access my desktop. Very user-friendly. When I had to get Windows 7 with a new computer, many of the programs I owned - including the expensive Coral"
Positive,"I had already ordered disc at good savings over online cost and went to install it automatically and kept renewing now screen. Plus it knocked off my one day saying I had no security. After uninstalling the original, the installation went smoothly."
Negative,For some reason this version won't download the banking information that I need. I had to go back to IBank.
Neutral,"Cloud player is a good way to play and track your Amazon purchased music. I can't see it replacing the player I'm currently using, but it has a clean interface. One thing that will stand out this app apart and greatly increase my usage would be if I could play my videos I purchased from Amazon as well. Amazon really needs an app for that... Going to the site on PC is fine but there is a clean video and music app that allows you"
Negative,Have used TurboTax for years with no real problems. The low rating is due to the following: Bought this in a store and discovered later when the state is trying to download that it is only federal! If I knew I would take a total of an extra modest $30 for download instead of an extra $30 for store. Last year the state was included with this version - this year Intuit's new fine donator tearing off their product line tore me
Neutral,"This program has some cute cards that you can create. It's not easy to be creative with it, other than the standard designs. Most cards you can't customize the cover."
Neutral,"All right, all right."
Negative,"I've been using Quickbook for over 20 years. I've learned to let my subscription go and as a new user I've learned to buy a new version of QuickBooks with an increased payroll. You just have to set your computer to a date that your QB previous subscription agrees with. For example, if your QB enhanced payroll ends on April 1, 2016 and it's May 22, 2016 and you need to run payroll. Just"
Negative,"I returned it because I couldn't reconcile it with the XP that was already running. The computer. Even after researching the reconciliation process, my laptop wouldn't accept it, so I returned it to the vendor."
Negative,"Because Money will no longer be offered, I decided to switch quickly it's as user-friendly or as useful as money."
Negative,"I was stuck in the dark ages of Paradox, when access to the file was too expensive and too complicated for the common mind. I owned the file at that time by Delphi, who took good care of it, when Corel had the top office software. Corel chose Paradox to complete the suite, then chose the suite for their suite, which included the hours, templates, and graphics, so it left the task of getting it to work."
Negative,"I just used a trial version of dvd cloner 6 and it copied my slightly scratched DVD fine! [...] you can see the features of many dvd copyers. And no, I don't work for the website! Also, the footprint for the download of coral is 306 megabytes! Also, it doesn't allow ""illegal copying"" of the dvd."
Negative,I wish I had less than 1 star... for loyal turbo tax users years... thank you to all who reviewed this... I bought one in store... got home and realized it looked wrong... I came here to see if I got a different version... & WOW!!!! WORST reviews ive ever seen on anything... well I got a different version...
Positive,"Photomatix offers a relatively robust and low-cost way to get into HDR photography, and I think it's a great creative tool. Although the basic idea is to stitch together images taken with different exposures, sometimes it's handy to use the program's tone mapping capabilities, even on a single image. I tend to start my work with T-shirts, HDRIF images that I usually use in a photo editing program"
Negative,No work on windows 8.
Positive,"Good price. Comes easy for schoolwork and what not. Loved that it came with enough computers for all of us,"
Positive,Awesome product is the best I've ever used.
Neutral,I had a little trouble updating the app but I finally did and it can automatically do like I do Amazon download music to iTunes.
Neutral,They will consider an alternative (and probably less expensive) product next year more than a decade after using Intuit products well.
Neutral,"I tried every trick in the book, including a LONG phone call to Microsoft. You can easily start the process, but you will always reach a point where an installer program tells you that it cannot connect to the Internet. This is important, because it is possible to save your installed programs and personal settings as you upgrade from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 8 Pro. It is also possible to save these two items as you upgrade from Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro. However, you"
Negative,"This product is like pop-up detection instant support, speed power pc, and my computer freezing due to."
Negative,"I have been successfully working with video for 5 years. I had Studio 8, which was satisfactory. I got a new system with plenty of space and energy. I run Windows XP Professional. I spent the last 7 days trying to get this thing to come up. No luck. I uninstalled, reinstalled, loaded every patch known to humanity. I even rendered without breathing. I rendered in almost all formats. The last 30% of any"
Positive,Today I used this program to rip a Lion's Gate DVD that was CSS saved to two VCDs that I later played on my DVD player and they played 100% good.
Negative,"If you need to watch Blu-Ray movies or want to watch all your SD/HD movies in 3D then CyberLink PowerDVD might be the product for you. It also has good slide show features and a streamlined interface. It can play music. I think it tries to make a lot of things happen at once. Maybe that's because I already have a routine established. I use VLC (free) to watch visual media, I use Google's"
Neutral,"Not having the money for Photoshop or Lightroom, I bought this software for the watermark and light touch ups. The Corel website lists most Nikon cameras being supported, but not the new ones. I took the chance because the images are the same *.nef that will open it, and they're not. I convert Nikon View software to *.TIF and then use PSP, too difficult and it opens images a little faster. I convert the photos I"
Neutral,I'm looking for a Photoshop replacement and it's very close... I had some problems with it. 1) There's no 64-bit version. My camera makes pictures that are 3056x4592 and are 16bit color. Editing those on a 32-bit application is painfully slow. I'm hoping this gets fixed soon since Painter is already 64 bits. 2) I couldn't find any way to take anything that's showing up and merge it
Positive,"I've been using the print master program for years. I've been doing all my own design work because I really enjoy it. Again, print Master hasn't let me down. I was a little frustrated when I upgraded to Windows 8 and it's inconsistent."
Negative,I'm in the process of going through numerous blue-screen trying to boot just Windows. I once ran Grim Fighter and now my computer is like this. I might have to reinstall Windows completely if it's damaged.
Positive,"The lessons proceed to phrases, gender, and multiple vs. single items. New items are often introduced with no explanation, you just use the hints provided by previously introduced words and ideas. It is very effective. I can't wait until I get to level 2 what's going on. The upper level is a negative interface."
Negative,Loaded on one device. Others tried and got error that there are no more available.
Neutral,"It looks like this year Intuit made the nickel and their customers' dime business decision. I'll probably go in another direction next year. Otherwise, the software worked just as well as the last few years I've used it."
Neutral,This product does not work with windows 10
Positive,I've been using Panda since 2009. I believe in Panda's level of protection. It amazes me that every year I get renewal offers from Panda for $89 when it sells for $10 on Amazon.
Positive,"I just need it to ensure that I save a certain amount each month, which, no matter your income level, is exactly what it does best. When I first started on the YNAB budget, I simply stuck the entire amount of my bank balance until that date to my ""saving class"" and the following month, I use ""saving class"" budget to lower the budget to the level I wanted."
Neutral,Old version
Negative,I've never been told I got a 2012 version rather than a 2014 version I had to send it back for 2014 version!
Negative,"It was faster, more accurate and easier to read. If you have no other choice, it's better than nothing. I'll invest a smart phone and aerospace mapping self."
Positive,Did the move.
Neutral,It was hard to download. I had to resort to Microsoft to help get it to work.
Negative,"I usually like QuickOn software, but I was putting the software on a different computer and the only thing I needed was basic banking. They wouldn't let me do that. I recovered my record from QuickOn from QuickOn Deluxe to QuickOn Starter so I stopped paying to get it upgraded by QuickOn."
Positive,Nice..
Positive,I bought this recording program I love it!
Negative,"It's hard to work as fast as usual, mainly because I honestly believe you don't have any real competition in your area of function. I we complain you can tell us to stuff it because Money is no longer around and no one else will enter the market. You have a real exclusive right and you can do anything you want to do. Your product is too expensive for what it does or doesn't do."
Neutral,"It probably also uses the data it collects for third-party purposes or something similar. And that says it's for users who browse the web and don't know what they're doing, that's using it."
Negative,I don't want to work with my Mac computer.
Negative,My first experience with Vista was a brand new laptop... a month of owning it and three complete OS crashes and a few app crashes.
Neutral,The only problem I have with the IOLO mechanic 6 is what they're trying to sell me before I sell the Mechanic 7 for less than a year.
Positive,It fixed my problem and I'm very happy with it.
Positive,"If you're running OS X Tiger Leopard on your Mac, you won't notice much of a difference. Aesthetically it's the same as Leopard, but under the hood there are a lot of features that help your system run faster, better."
Neutral,"I've been using QuickOn for almost 20 years (maybe more?!) and I like a lot of its strong features for personal financial management. Although they've been upgraded to significant changes or improvements for quite some time. The only real reason for upgrading is to get access to transaction downloading features, which are very easy. It's not certain how much they'll cost to support it, but it may not be very easy to save -"
Negative,"I started using Quicken in 1994 and have been entering every financial transaction since then. I was recently forced to leave Quicken 2006 Basic by Quicken because they won't let me download the stock quote anymore. Quicken 2006 Basic was a great program and I hated to see it, but I was hoping that the 2009 Deluxe would be even better. Boy I was wrong. In short, the interface is so complex and complicated that navigating"
Neutral,Norton is good but I need a CD so I can download it for my comp and IM phone.
Negative,Save yourself a lot of trouble and just stick with version 12. This program is very buggy and problematic. Crashes whenever I try to use it.
Neutral,"The previous year's tax data porting was not as complete as it should have been when it was compared to previous years. The 2014 version brought everything over from 2013, Several items had to be entered again manually. . . ."
Negative,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HONESTECH.. I just bought from BestBuy on Friday 1st once installed VIDBOX driver needs to be updated directly out of the box. Second number I don't connect to the Honestech site for registration.
Positive,It's one of the best set of tutorials I've ever seen.
Negative,I believe the program automatically loads with auto renewal. Also will charge your credit card 45 up the day before your subscription. Very shady.
Neutral,Not as good as other versions we have used before
Negative,I can't use some of it because I need a Microsoft live account and mine. It's not working properly and I've been dealing with this crap since I buy the program of which Microsoft keeps sending me the same text or email over and over again.
Negative,"It looks totally different from Quick for Windows. The real pain in transferring data from Windows to Mac. I tried to update my online and it didn't work, and inside it actually ruined some of my account balance completely."
Neutral,"Everything is fine and the GPS is running well, but first trying the GPS led me to a dead end street and then said to turn left where the turn was obviously taken a few years ago. I went back and the GPS then found a new route that was right."
Positive,Works great the only thing I was missing was a tremolo effect but that's okay:)
Neutral,Turbo tax was more user friendly than this software and it was very easy to go back and adjust things. I am disappointed that I didn't spend the extra money on the turbo tax.
Positive,"Because of the good price ($33.99), I decided to give it a try. The software was a snap to load and I was copying my tapes to DVD in no time. The quality is good to use the whole cables. I doubt it would be even better to use the S-video cable but I don't have one in my VHS player. I've made 8 DVDs from VHS so far. I'm not sure why this product had"
Negative,"Well, I read others' reviews but thought that people were just complaining. How wrong I was! I should have heard. I used Dragon for Microsoft at work and was very excited to use the software for my personal practice on my Mac. I try to work from a template so I already have different titles of sections of my reports. As I try to fill in the info under each section, dictate writes over my title and delete what I wrote - it's"
Positive,Great for keeping a record of valuable property.
Negative,Slow down my computer!
Neutral,I also have 2 pieces of puzzle missing... anyone found the solution yet?
Positive,I've been using it for years and will continue for years to come.
Positive,Best map program ever and has been used for business and personal use for 17 years.
Neutral,"Like the Quickbooks Online service, which I tried for a month, Intuit can't seem to import categories and payees correctly. Instead of ""Safeway,"" comes out ""Store XXX""; categories are also far away; one would think that Safeway was ""stuff to get rid of""; Quicken thinks users will have to manually fix errors."
Negative,We are unable to upload our invoice tracker to the Excel spreadsheet. We are unable to upload our price list to the Excel spreadsheet for different customers. We are looking for different rates for different customers (i.e. repair: $100.00 first hour; $70 per extra hour; drafting per job up to 15 windows: $80.00) with billable hours of $80.00) with customers unable to customize invoices
Positive,Free program I need to do everything in the office is compatible with all Office files? Why didn't I find out so quickly?!? Great download... I highly recommend it!
Positive,I like it and its buying power.
Neutral,"Good game... I have played better, looking for more hidden object games, not solving mysteries..."
Neutral,"I went the safe route and it cost me $$ when I got back. Also, the item value that the application (donation) didn't work. I have very mixed feelings about this product."
Neutral,Too much of a learning curve for me.
Positive,"I've used different versions of this product before, so I wasn't completely unfamiliar with it. I like to use Excel, especially in creating a guest list for an upcoming party. I use Word frequently when creating file folder labels at home. It's very easy to do with the Avery Wizard. Overall, this product suits my at-home needs perfectly."
Negative,Don't buy rip off has been used since 1998 no more
Positive,Great item -- great seller
Negative,"For example, it continues to try to log on to their webpage despite the fact that I have set it not to check updates. After waiting 10 hours to do a big defrag, when I re-tested it told me that the hard drive was still 18% broken. Perhaps the most frustrating fact is that they never respond to your technical support emails... I can't recommend anyone buying this product."
Positive,"I bought this product last year and again this year I'm getting frustrated with the turbo tax. It worked fine, but I found one glitch. It wouldn't accept my fourth quarterly payment due on January 15th for some reason."
Neutral,Every laptop owner should have it.
Neutral,"My sons (5 and 3) love Callow but don't love this game! The games are very simple, boring and not much fun. Simply put, I mean that there's very little you get to do and they could have been made for ten+ computers years ago. The Caillou character doesn't talk and you can't move him around (except on the flying game where he moves just like a mouse arrow, he never moves his arms"
Positive,That's great.
Positive,"I'm running Windows 10 and it's working flawlessly. I saw a lot of negative reviews and asked if I should buy it, but at only $20 I figured I didn't have much to lose. I'm happy about it. I think you need a very good microphone. I have a Koss cs-100, which is supposed to be the top rated microphone. I highly recommend this product."
Neutral,"Okay, but I never use it and it always pops up."
Neutral,"""Hello Kitty"" is the advertising hook for this product mathematical problem, when it has very little to do with sound and charming, academically, character."
Neutral,"Norton antivirus is actually one of the two big players in the antivirus game (the other is MacAfee). Once I have both installed on my computer, I have to say that I like Norton - maybe it's nothing more than the slick user interface, but I like working with it more than the other. This product gives you the basics - AntiVirus protection. It doesn't give you any of the upgraded features, such as parental controls or"
Neutral,"I've read the 300GP owner's subscription manual at least three times, but I've actually tried to buy the same software, but I've finally gotten a few tunes, and I've got some pretty amazing software. From all the appearances, it's a product that's been delivered to you, and I'm going to say that you've got to buy a lot of extra software, and I'm going to say"
Positive,It doesn't have the latest tax laws but it only works for us to keep good business records.
Positive,My computer won't function without a webroot.
Positive,"This was probably one of the most surprisingly good purchases I've ever made. I wasn't convinced that I'd like to have a GPS sound like this, but my wife convinced me, and I'm glad she did! Since then we've bought a few others (like the kit from Night Rider), and the other voices are great, but this is my favorite so far."
Positive,"So the software is not there much to say, the download was quick and easy. And the information is stored on Amazon's cloud in case you have a loss."
Negative,"I've been using the old Street Atlas 7.0 for about five years and I'm really happy with it. I use it for planning on my home machine and with GPS for traveling on my laptop. My grip is mild, there are some minor annoying errors in the database, and I refuse to remember my settings when I leave. I upgraded because DeLorme offered an easy discount and I thought that in five years they sent the interface."
Positive,I've used it for over 10 years and it's better to keep it.
Neutral,"This product is probably worth 4-5 stars. I gave it 3 because it didn't keep me engaged enough to go through the whole program, so I never learned the language. That's the original. I personally like Rosetta Stone because it shows your sound waves and records how you say a word or a sentence. I learned better with it because I was able to correct myself."
Positive,Worked for me.
Negative,"Man, what I wish I had read before switching to SystemWorks from 2002 to 2005. A family member suggested I buy the software. than just subscribing for updates... BIG mistake. Before I had a perfectly working GoBack. Now it won't even install (since I had to uninstall the old version to install the new one). It's that I now rely on System Restore."
Neutral,"It gets the job done, but there are some obvious programming errors in business expenses, when entering the home office, and many others."
Positive,The software allows us to zoom in directly from it.
Positive,Use it every year - never had a problem or made a mistake using it.
Negative,Much of the complexity of my use
Negative,"I thought it was the book of Essentials of Marketing, but after I paid I only got the study guide which is not briefly related to the blackboard, please I need a refund"
Positive,The product is amazingly fast and well integrated with Mac OS X. I recommend it to anyone running Windows apps on Mac.
Negative,"I tried it on a 500g external drive and the same thing happened. Both drives report healthy! Total waste of money and time. Post, leave messages in the service and no call back! Bad deal, bad service... freeware is better!"
Positive,It's easy to install and works in the background so far so good are you like most of its capabilities
Positive,Really gets you up and running fast!
Positive,The value by who all the others are judged!
Positive,"I've never tried Norton 360 and I'll let braver souls than I figure out why not. (cough-cough) Remember, No program is going to make you 100% safe. But Norton at least makes you THINK you are and that really matters."
Neutral,The instructions aren't really clear and I can't find anything online to either help it won't let me copy anything or download the video.
Negative,"Unfortunately, it took me 2+ hours to update the software. The problem was an error message that said: ""you are attempting to install a program that has a publisher that is UNKNOWN"". So as a graduate of many cyber defense courses, I refused to download that part of the update file. In fact, the file was, in fact, a valid TurboTax client file needed to update the program. After much search, I was able"
Negative,Norton slowed my computer so much that he deleted the program and returned as soon as I got it. For my new all-in-one computer I will use something less aggressive. Norton uses a lot of memory and slows down processing significantly.
Neutral,"What you won't get from Instant Emerson Spanish is ""instant fluency"". I didn't use Rosetta Stone, so I can't compare, but if you're looking to speak fluent Spanish, I'm not sure this is the right product."
Neutral,"After using QuickKn since 1993, my previous upgrade to QuickKn 2001 was a DOS-based product - a Windows-based product - both capabilities and improved user-friendliness. However the transition from QuickKn 2001 to 2012 did NOT provide any enhancements that would improve performance or user-friendliness."
Negative,I am using Mac OS 10.10.5 and am unable to put Kindle in the Dock for Mac. Which makes it get Kindle more. Less use because I work with other applications and want to check a source in a book in Kindle. So I got a Mac edition of Kindle considerably less useful. It does open in the Application folder.
Neutral,It's good
Negative,"The ""check for updates"" feature didn't work. After several attempts with no success, I proceeded without the updates, but will get to some steps where it will tell me that the form I needed was not yet available (I need to file 2 days before my return, no less!!), so I couldn't get in for example information about state and local sales taxes."
Neutral,Last year there was a problem with the software -- it didn't let me e-file the state return if I wanted to share the refunds when I applied next year and getting a direct-deposit refund. This year it was the reverse of the same problem!
Positive,Great price and very easy to use.. I've been using H&R Block software for 15 years or so and never had any problems doing my taxes.
Negative,Not at all what I expected!
Positive,"It has a number of ways to speed up data entry, especially when sources are cited, and it lets you know if you enter dates that may conflict with other dates. It is a very good way to mix up the data entry of various websites such as Ancestry.com, which makes it easy for your child to search your web page on the pages of your interests. It has a number of ways to improve data entry, especially when sources are cited, and it lets"
Neutral,The condition of however the product has a lot left to be desired or I should say the box it was packed in. Crushed to the max; somehow the cd managed to be ok. The item was purchased from an Amazon affiliate.
Neutral,"I still have to skip to high speed settings to get it, all the current backgrounds are turned off (Windows 98). The feature I bought is software for works, (the slide show with audio). Although it wasn't as easy as a plug and play software should be, I did have to use the Tech Support to get this feature to work."
Positive,They always bail me out if I screw up. Great online support. They may take a while to get to you. But when they do they do really well. I've used them on my PC for the last 12 years or so.
Negative,The software works great. The reseller refused to get me a registration to support the card from the red hat.
Positive,This arrived very quickly and in good shape. The download went very well and the product is working as expected.
Positive,"I recover a lot of photos for genealogy lovers; Photo Impact 11 is, so far, the best program I've found for work. It's an easy-to-learn hiring toolset that allows expert level work with layers, cloning and objects. Photo Impact allows me to work quickly and provide the same professional level of available results with Photoshop and Corel for a fraction of the cost."
Negative,"I'm on a Mac with Word and Excel all crash time even before I can save documents and they don't always reload when I restart the app. They have all the updates they claim time, in part, to help fix them. Those two programs can take up to 5 minutes to launch! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
Positive,"It's a very bloated program, but DNS has always had a big, fat piece of software. It's okay, maybe a little better than Google or Siri as far as accuracy is concerned."
Negative,This Easy Media Creator 10 is the worst software that I have ever bought with the name Roxio on it. It is a bundle of about 8-10 different applications. Most of the applications don't have enough programming power to perform the action required for that application. It's almost like having a virus built into every application. Some examples: My DVD - This app caused a problem with stopping background music at the beginning of the recorded/burned project. My DVD Express -
Negative,"It doesn't include processing tax forms, just showing checks and printing payroll checks. Intuit should be ashamed, greedy and corrupt company. I was forced to buy software from them and pay a monthly fee for payroll processing."
Positive,I got this one as a gift for someone and they love the product too... and I'm very happy with the services and products I've bought.
Neutral,Don't use it much. It's different than Pandora or Spotify.
Positive,I've been using turbo for years without any tax problems.
Negative,I tried several times to download this software on my iMac computer. The software was defective and refused to load.
Neutral,"Turbo Tax 2014 was easy to follow and walked me through my various deductions. However, when doing my donations the program gave me the option of using various instead of entering multiple dates for my donation. When the program was checking for accuracy it said that different valid dates were not entered and gave me a date, but did not give me the option of entering more than one donation date."
Negative,"I ordered French 8.0 (I didn't specify the version.); I was sent French 8.01. This version didn't work on my PC - DELL or my laptop - IBM at all. I called the learning company, told them what I was getting an error message; they immediately told me, ""This version didn't work on some PCs... they don't know why"". If they offered a refund I returned the product. I mailed the product to"
Negative,"If you're a gamer, especially a Steam gamer this is the worst internet security product !!! I threw it in 2 weeks after trying garbage everything to get it to work well with online games !!!"
Neutral,"I switched the computer. I moved the program (the paid version) to a new computer, including all the journal entry files. However, I needed a registration license to use it. After all these years, I still don't have access to that number. So I went to the website - where I still have my online account - and I sent an email asking for the number. Never heard back from them. So I figured I would just spend the money and buy the program"
Neutral,"A fair interface, but Miss Macro, is a weird 'ribbon' for accessory functions. I don't see why Microsoft is bothered, except to establish its market dominance in .docx format."
Positive,Buy this every year!
Neutral,"Not as easy to use as a book, it's basically a huge PDF. However, it's full of technical information and it seems like you need everything you need."
Negative,"According to Microsoft, MSDN retailers were told about the product with an old activation code that will not be valid on 06/2004. But Amazon is still shipping this expired product NO GOOD. I have to wait 3 more weeks to get MSDN. What a hassle."
Negative,I've had issues with this program. I bought it and their technology doesn't support the following up with the issue.
Positive,"I feel like the other reviewers are telling a very unfair story. I didn't buy it because of them. But instead, I find the interface to be seamless, and top notch. All of the features of the previous Quicken version go very well. I had no problem transferring my Windows 2000 Basic Data (thousands of transactions and more) to 15 accounts into my new Quicken 2004 Mac File, and that is as cross-platform"
Negative,"I was interested in learning to speak the language. The program was easy to use, but I couldn't stick with it. Find the annoying, glitchy, and hard sound differences. I could hear that I wasn't saying the same words, but there was no guidance to help with pronunciation difficulties."
Neutral,"Yes, temporarily, after installing this upgrade and the required updates, the Windows 8.1 service pack itself will be able to access the Windows 8.1 file system after the installation of the upgraded file system itself. (Since the Windows 8.1 service pack itself will be available on the Windows 8.1 operating system. Since the Windows 8.1 operating system itself does not require a Microsoft account, you can consider replacing the first file system with a ""local"" account on the machine where you signed"
Positive,"The smaller SD memory card did a great job, you put it in the garmin, I was pleasantly surprised, it took us where ever we needed to go in Jamaica. The larger SD card that you put on your computer or laptop, we couldn't get the laptop to read it or download it to the garmin."
Positive,Norton 360 has been my companion for over two years and I fully enjoy security. I had another brand that failed to protect me when my computer was attacked and all the documents were lost as a result. I switched to Norton 360 and I'm very happy that I did.
Positive,Love it... listen to it every day!
Neutral,"I'm a heavy map user - I've been using roads and trips for over a decade, and I'm using Mappoint for organizing things (Microsoft's other map tools) (to split the properties between the representatives in the first place), and I have 400 customers who have points on the map that I have to figure out who I'm going to meet every day. I'm a heavy map user - I've been using ro"
Positive,"It's both educational and entertaining, even I was a kick out of it. I completely forgot about it until I dug around the toy chest and I sat with the kids again. I must say the best feature of this game was the word recognition and word building. I can't wait to buy them another leapfrog."
Negative,Wasn't working for me.
Neutral,"I'm not a demanding user and have used Quicken since Money left the market many years ago. I've been looking at these reviews for months and they've been stopped upgrading until it seems safe. It's time. Nothing unfortunate has happened yet but I'm reserving judgment, thus the Average review."
Negative,What was good about TurboTax was the fact that you could file up to 5 returns without paying extra.
Negative,"I was surprised that doing my return I got a popup saying I had to spend 30 dollars to add ""premium"" more. Now what I hit on the input was $5 input and I want an extra $30 for the Intuit upgrade. What really bothered me was that when I audited the tax, the Turbo tax didn't catch the discrepancy and let me go."
Positive,"It's a nice product, brought me up to date and made life easier."
Positive,Really love it its greatttttttt
Neutral,I couldn't find this one!
Neutral,There's also a new version slowly changing into the company. Don't know why they upgraded new doesn't seem to have many improvements!!
Neutral,"When it works, it works well, but about 25 percent of the time the lips and the words don't match, and in one instance it's translated into Spanish, it sucks support, it takes weeks for them to get back to you and they don't help in any way."
Neutral,The software can only be downloaded once. Too much money to be able to use on second child's schooling.
Neutral,"AVG Tuneup was installed immediately and it worked because I didn't register it. A few weeks later, I tried to use it again on the same PC and he asked me to register it."
Neutral,ok
Neutral,"The lessons are repetitive, and there aren't many to choose from. I would recommend the program for a beginner ESL student, but as I said at the beginning, there aren't many exercises, all presented in the same order, and there isn't a very wide variety. No workbook comes with the program and no instructions. It becomes difficult for someone who is completely new to computers to follow."
Neutral,"I've been using Quicken 2007 for Windows or Mac for about 20 years now. I bought Quicken 2015 for Mac last year and I hate it more than Quicken 2007 for Mac, and especially Quicken for Windows. I got my money back from Intuit. But in reading some of the reviews for Quicken 2016 for Mac, things seemed to be a little better now and I took the plunge again. Bad decision. Im still no fan"
Neutral,"Delorme, you really need to take some lessons, or you need to make some deals with Google or other map providers and search engines. Your software is not as easy to use as it was 10 years ago, and many, many streets are missing from maps!"
Negative,"I had expected above all else that when I ordered this problem for my Mac that it would be a user-friendly program, easy to navigate, more interactive, and with an elegant application. It was just the opposite. The program is not user-friendly or tech-savvy. It seemed like it was a cumbersome program and it had nothing to attract me. So I sent it back immediately."
Negative,I didn't know what platform it was supported and discovered. I couldn't use this set and had to return it.
Positive,"I like the feature of importing last this year's tax return, and the automatic calculation of forward carrying."
Positive,"I don't have to specify what period you want to bring in data from, so you have to contact each institution and see if they support the quick import of the previous data and merge it. It's even harder: I want to find a good credit card file or data file that doesn't appear available for Excel, but it's not easy to find that if it's not available for Mac, it's not easy to find a data file or data file"
Neutral,I can't really say one way or the other since the drawing board doesn't work at all.
Negative,"While this product advertises a rich list of features, it is so full of bugs that even a technically knowledgeable average consumer will not be able to navigate the product satisfactorily. The program starts very slowly, the program responds very slowly when it is running at the end, the bonus DVD does not load, video playback is choppy, and on my machine the video playback lacked sound. Also, Pinnacle's support has to"
Neutral,"There is honestly so much that can be said about Microsoft in the way they have made great computer software. But honestly, there have been some software's that have been honestly not worth the money. When I had found out that MIcrosoft was going to limit its office software bundles to a subscription service a few years ago, I was honestly more unaffected about the decision, because I thought that if you have bundles, it would be particularly up"
Negative,I was trying to share a large file.
Negative,I bought a 3-year subscription. I log in and it says I only have 28 days of service. I've lost 3 years in the cyber space. I contacted Bitdefender and this week after... still no response! I'm uninstalling and discussing visa charges.
Neutral,The other 2 units L will work fine. 32 will be recommended for the bit system.
Negative,"I hope I can give no to the star this, this CD is broken"
Negative,"Same junk under a new blooming UI coating. Don't buy it. Buy 2010 if you need an office, much more straightforward than this version."
Neutral,It's installed but not sure if it's working.
Positive,"Since I have an older version of Windows XP. These versions of Excel and Word were fine for my desktop PC at a very good price. I gave it 4 stars because, although it also loaded on my laptop PC, I couldn't register it on my laptop because I already registered it on my PC. It was downloaded on my laptop, but it says it will only last for 90 days on my laptop and then I have to reinstall it."
Negative,"This new version has lost some of the key editing capabilities that existed in version 3. They are: 1) while in 3D mode, you can't edit objects in your design in terms of size and location (windows, doors, etc.). 2) While in 3d mode you can no longer preselect your view position (accomplished via the ""view angle window"" that would pop up in version 3 and provide a non-rendered preview of your"
Neutral,"I'm used to some delays due to some changes in the desktop since 2011, but no big deal. I like the mobile app but the 'ending balance' issue (caused by incorrect handling of split entries) is a problem and doesn't make the app as useful as it should be."
Negative,"I used older versions so I had a pretty good idea how to use it. HOWEVER, the best resource is usually the help file. This file is not on the software disc. You have to go to the Internet to find the help files. This is not acceptable to me and I will look for other options."
Positive,"No bad thing can be said, I love my Mac. Great upgrade added and fast."
Negative,"I'm using XP, and although I'm not sure that XP is the problem, there's a label on the box that proudly states ""XP Compatible"". I doubt this is actually an issue, I think the program is just poorly done. In most intances I would do some problem solving, but with this software it would just be a waste of time I made a quick refund of my time I want to make a print shop because I hate my"
Neutral,Not as good as the XP version.
Positive,You can still get the latest version of Lightroom without requiring a subscription.
Negative,"I think I have a pretty high tolerance for software that requires a tough learning curve or is challenging to use. You have to be like that if you are into graphics for movies and games. But for some reason posters bother me more than others. I hate installer power, then go to their website and find out how to download and install the ""rest"" of the posters. Then go to another website to download enough content to make the poser useful. Then"
Positive,Great price and fast shipping.
Negative,crapola
Neutral,The software looks like it was made in 2004. It would be helpful if the e-file actually works. Not sure it was worth it.
Positive,Can't imagine being without taxes
Positive,Excellent to approach an aggressive protection method......!
Positive,"I've been using Total Defense Premium Internet Security, for a couple of months now, and I must say that I'm very impressed and satisfied with this product. It's very seamless and has a very small setup footprint and can be used on many devices. It doesn't have the big name recognition of Norton or Maccaffey, and I was a little hesitant to try it at first but after using both, Total Defense beat them"
Positive,all right
Negative,"I downloaded the QuickCon Premier from Amazon and tried to use a backup from QuickCon07. Password vault went empty, I couldn't enter any passwords in the vault. In addition I couldn't even connect a password at a time when I update a personal account. I won't buy this program again."
Neutral,"The exercises themselves are terrific and the ""tutor"" is great. However, this product has MANY usability issues which, for me, rate this product a HUGE disappointment. For starters, there is no way to run it on a part of your computer screen. You either prefer Fluenz full screen mode or you are not running it on a very limited time, so luckily you try to read any text or monitor other applications."
Negative,I have to register to download something that requires an activation key. It's more annoying that they need you to pay them your cell phone to register. It won't be a landline accept.
Neutral,What's the difference between over 65 and special 65? Also won't let you go back and e-file your state return when you don't do it your federal ..
Positive,"Now regarding the VB.NET language and the Framework, anyone who claims this is ""as slow is Java"" is running on old hardware or not enough memory of VS.NET. If you have a free IDE for ASP.NET development called WebMatrix. If you are looking for a VB.NET counterpart to VB6 Standard edition then, this product fits the bill perfectly."
Positive,"I ordered it as a work requirement. I like it much better than OpenOffice that I was using. Easy to use, quick to download, very user-friendly."
Negative,"There are no clear system requirements in the product information. After I bought it, I guessed it would win 95/98. The program was just running on my win7. The story is stupid, pictures are ugly, mini games are simple but no proper instruction for kids. Don't waste your money!"
Neutral,I just wish the lifetime came with Tom Tom it was ever cheaper for them to buy GPS on top of lifetime maps.
Neutral,Sometimes it works like magic and other times it seems to scramble some of the letter.
Positive,It's working as advertised.
Negative,"The primary reason I switched to the mac about 8 months ago was because Microsoft produces incredibly buggy, terrible software. Unfortunately, I sometimes need to use Microsoft Office, so I got Office for Mac. Office not only sucks PCs, it sucks very much."
Positive,I've been using this for years and it seems to work well at catching malware and viruses but I'm not a computer expert.
Negative,"With the purchase of a Visioneer OneTouch 5800, the paperport came VR7.02. Even after reading the help files, I am not able to use the OCR capability. I am not able to get on the Internet for paperports. I had Adobe PhotoDeluxe and OmniPage before. I believe I'll reload and update them and go from there."
Negative,"For the record, I am dictating this review, using MacSpeech Dictate. As others have done, I will leave in any errors period. (Like that one!) Four [for] years, I had hoped that someone would develop a voice recognition program for the Mac that was as good as Dragon NaturallySpeaking (now you want us [Nuance]) both ViaVoice and I listen [iListen] were just terrible products, so bad"
Positive,"I love the app, my books go with me, and any tool is great too!!"
Neutral,"If you've bought a system mechanic, make sure you know which version you're buying. This was version 8 and after loading it I had to reinstall Windows 10."
Neutral,"I submitted my question to help line several times without getting a response. In Schedule CA in the California form tax exempt municipal bond taxes are being re-added to the AGI before the tax is calculated, which has raised my state tax to $1,500."
Neutral,There really is no recognizable difference between the 2016 and 2015 versions. If you already have 2015 you can skip the upgrade
Positive,"Perfect for your own taxes, easy to use!"
Negative,I'm disappointed that this version of Turbo doesn't include all the features it has in the past. Intuit made the changes without letting anyone know and it has been firing anti-turbo shots at them.
Positive,"I'd tried a couple of other programs first and, although I'm pretty experienced with software, found they took more effort to learn than I was willing to put them into when I was only using them temporarily for a specific project. I wanted a program that I could learn in a few minutes, and Sweet Home 3D is definitely that!"
Positive,Great antivirus and doesn't mess with other programs like drivers did some other brands like McCaff.
Positive,"Overall a great program, but 1) templates a very similar one to another; they don't show much creative use of features; 2) no dynamic capabilities, 3) related to #2, a completely different desktop version from any mobile web site you've created."
Negative,"I bought this thinking it would be easy to use in our small library for our school and it wasn't! We tried to call the number for help and it took a while to get someone to answer. We got someone who was there, asked us to email any questions, then it took a while to get them to respond, and when you were in the middle of setting up a library, it was frustrating! It was like they were working out of their home! Not a business"
Positive,I love it! No ads and MANY SONGS OUT THERE NOT FUND on other sites
Negative,"This program is a let down after Apple's much simpler program, iMovie. I've used Adobe Premier Pro and I like it, but I need something like this for my Mac, probably like Premier Express. No way! It's a cumbersome program."
Neutral,"I called Kaspersky and after much discussion it was decided I should install ""Internet Security"". I asked for a credit for my purchase of the ""anti-virus"". Kaspersky refused. I then asked for a less expensive upgrade price and again, they rejected. I had to buy an additional security program, ""Internet Security"", through Amazon. The new security program fixed my machine and is performing quite well. No complaints."
Neutral,"So I now owe a penalty for 2012 -- I tried calling Turbotax but couldn't find a phone number -- I just got a message from a third party that I didn't feel comfortable with. Turbotax says that they will help if you are audited,etc,etc,etc."
Positive,I liked it very well. I upgraded to the 64-bit version. I have not had a single unexpected problem. I made a new system for it. I tested it before I bought it and tested the compatibility.
Negative,"I've been using NTI CD Maker Gold for a while and I can only say that it caused more problems than burning. I found the ""smart choice"" option particularly troubling. Software prompts you to every time you try to burn a media: the program asks you (in practice forces you most of the time) to ""burn"" to a temporary file on the HD instead of if your data is less than the size of a CD/DVD"
Negative,"While I'm obliged to upgrade my business to run with QuickOn, I encourage others to wait a good six months after no release. In addition to the difficulty of getting the new version addressed by banks and brokers, the program has lost functionality, due to rampant bugs. The ""Quicken Community"" cites a number of them. I know they will get sorted out. It surprises me that over the four decades I've"
Positive,"While NAV 7.0 offers Mac users good protection from most ""known"" computer viruses, I have found that you can create the same LiveUpdate file file interface as NAV 6.0, not only the ""macro"" viruses which infected some Macintosh computer systems before Microsoft made a patch available to MS Word users last year. (Be sure to use the ""Word Count"" feature on any ""old"" MS Word files that were created prior to using NAV"
Neutral,"Until you're filing a very simple return, avoid Turbo Tax. HR Block found added $500 on State and my federal tax bill reduced by $2500 Be advised"
Positive,good
Positive,"I just have to say that Norton Internet Security 2014 it's a friendly software, and Windows 8 performance is very good."
Negative,"The first thing I noticed was that the installation program for the business part was clunky, slow, and it seemed to be designed when Windows 3 was new. Once the program was loaded, many of the sounds in the dialog box were cut off and the in buttons, etc. It's just not acceptable. However, the biggest problem is that the program claims to support e-files for business, and the web site accepts you to download free business ("
Positive,"Soy usuario de Family Tree Maker desde hace aos y peridicamente compro en Amazon las actualizaciones. Hace un mes compre en Amazon la versión 2009 (necessary) que he has a two-day receipt in Argentina, which is a problem and a low in the meeting."
Neutral,"Great tactics training sections, but I can only give this three stars because the ""Print"" function works so badly. I want to print the strategy problems that I have for further study as a group, but it will only print the small diagrams about an inch or so across and grainy as well. I have tried to find a fix but failed."
Negative,"It's not exactly the same, but Garmin has gone crazy about me twice when I was in areas that weren't great to lose."
Neutral,There are problems transferring money from one account to another account not as good as Microsoft funds.
Positive,The program loaded without any hitches and seems to work very well.
Neutral,I buy this product mainly to keep track of our expenses and expenses. It's everything I hope it will be and I found it very easy to use and understand.
Negative,"I spent $39 on this just for federal. Nowadays, federal is free online. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. You have to pay another $39 for the state, and another $19.95 to the file package says that I got a discount for $19.95 when I bought it."
Negative,"I found CyberLink PhotoDirector 7 Ultra less than advertised. Virtually all better photo editing software has had its functions in some form for several years. Although the same functions are available in virtually all of the better photo editing software in such software it takes a bit more effort to implement this function. However, additional efforts yield better results. For example; using PhotoDirector to achieve satisfactory results with ""background removal"" requires a cloning"
Negative,We were using Calendar Creator 2 (which is not compatible with Windows XP). I bought and installed Calendar Creator Deluxe v12 and it did not support many features in version 2.
Negative,"Ok Amazon this is the second time I've wiped this app off my Mac in a single day. None of the covers are showing up, when I try to delete a book from the Mac app it doesn't go anywhere. It's on them and since I can't see the covers I'm always clicking on it and thinking about this other book."
Negative,"I felt as if I was at fault when it wouldn't play my DVD movies. After all, it said it was playing in a variety of other formats, but it asked for more money to get it to play my regular DVD movies. MS left us film players at the mercy of these people (and I use the term loosely) and I needed something with a lot more oomph so I bought Nero Platinum in 2017 to relax and I'm pretty happy now,"
Positive,"Proposal Pack Wizard is very helpful in organizing individual sections. Breaking sections into pieces, it makes the effort more doable. Really like this product."
Neutral,"I have been using this software since the early 2000s, especially when I started using the same software as my home theater setup, which already supports a 65"" Panasonic Plasma, Denon AV receiver, a WDTV Live Hub, PS3 and a network PC that is compatible with my home DVD/Video library, music, pictures and a red array. I have already installed this software in my home theater setup. I want to make sure"
Negative,"The app signs out constantly. There is no option to save your login info, it signs out up to 4 or 5 times a day, and the app stops working completely until you log back in. Every time I look at my computer I know that the app is sitting, waiting for me to log out again. It makes the whole thing completely worthless. My computer is still running 24/7, because it's constantly logging out, it took me two and a half months"
Neutral,The Norton Anti Virus is excellent - The Personal Firewall is not good for MacOSX - the product description should be pretty clear about it! - I bought it - and it will not work on MacOSX - and there are NO updates from the manufacturer!
Neutral,These DVDs are out of date after a few months. You can get the software for free online.
Positive,"Quickbook is perfect for my small business. It's so amazingly flexible and time-saving. I've been using it for years now, and I have a familiar bias, but you certainly can't beat it for the price. Just make sure get help while setting things up. Their tech support is only free for one month so use it! When you first install it, ask some questions about what kind of company you are, and if you make a bad choice you"
Positive,"I bought this for my daughter-in-law, who is very into sewing. She started using it on Christmas Day and it's not off. She can't stop being crazy about it."
